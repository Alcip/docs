## Security Hardening <Badge text="draft" type="error"/>


## Service Account
A service account is a user identity that is associated with a service executable (such as SalesTim) for the purpose of providing a security context for that service.

**Why do we NEED a service account?**  
SalesTim relies intensively on the Microsoft Graph API. Therefore it's important to understand its permissions model and basic requirements.  

**Understand delegated and application permissions**  
Microsoft Graph has two types of permissions:
* ***Delegated permissions*** are used by apps that have a signed-in user present. For these apps either the user or an administrator consents to the permissions that the app requests and the app can act as the signed-in user when making calls to Microsoft Graph. Some delegated permissions can be consented by non-administrative users, but some higher-privileged permissions require administrator consent.
* ***Application permissions*** are used by apps that run without a signed-in user present. For example, apps that run as background services or daemons. Application permissions can only be consented by an administrator.

::: tip
Due to some Microsoft Graph functional and technical limitations, SalesTim now relies on a delegated permission model. In the future, SalesTim will switch to an application model.

**How we're securing it?**
- **Least-Privilege Administrative Models**: Every single requested permission scope is documented and justified. See [Required Permissions](#required-permissions)
- **Authentication**: We're not storing any login / password combination, and service account configuration can only be performed by one of your administrators.

**Minimal requirements**  
Service account minimal requirements:
- Must be assigned at least an Office 365 E1 license
  * Why: The service account must be a regular Office 365 user
- Must be a member of your Office 365 Global admins group
  * Why: To perform administrative operations on groups, especially gain the "owner" status on any existing group.
- Must have an enabled license to Microsoft Teams
  * Why: To perform administrative operations on Microsoft Teams artefacts
- Must have an enabled license to Exchange Online and its Exchange Online mailbox must be provisioned
  * Why: To send email notifications in a secure way inside customer's domain, respecting internal mail flow rules

::: warning MFA (Multi-factor authentication)
If you enforce MFA for the service account AFTER it has been configured in SalesTim, you MUST update it from the "Settings" tab using the "ðŸŽ­ Update" button.
:::

**Is the service account visible to end-users?**  
Even if the service account is performing actions in the background (Such as provisioning and other administrative operations), it may appear to end-user in some cases:
- It is seen as the teams and associated resources (such as planner) creator
- Its profile picture and name appear as the sender of notifications

So choose the name you want, this can be the name of your IT Service for instance, and add a nice picture! :-)

## Security Best practices

This list is for sure not exhaustive, but may give you some guidelines on how to secure your service accounts:

### 1. Enforce service account security with MFA
SalesTim service account supports Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA). MFA adds an additional layer of protection, ensuring that service account declaration or update is done by an authorized person.

### 2. Keep access limited
Ensure you only allocate AD service accounts the minimum privileges they require for the tasks they need to carry out, and donâ€™t give them any more access than is necessary. In many cases you can remove the functionality for remote access, terminal service login, internet access, and remote control rights.

### 3. Create service accounts from scratch.
Donâ€™t create service accounts in Active Directory by copying old ones, as you might accidentally be copying from a service account with much higher privileges than you need. This could lead to security issues and account misuse if you give someone an account with access to resources or information they shouldnâ€™t be privy to.

### 4. Donâ€™t put service accounts in built-in privileged groups.
Putting service accounts in groups with built-in privileges can be risky, because each person in the group will have access to the service accountâ€™s credentials. If thereâ€™s account misuse, it can be hard to figure out who the offender is. If you need a service account for a privileged group, create a new group with the same privileges and allow access only to the service account.

### 5. Control password configuration.
You can set a service account so the user canâ€™t change their own password. You can also set it so the account canâ€™t be delegated to someone else. This ensures the administrator controls the password, and nobody other than authorized users has access to the account.

### 6. Enable auditing.
Be sure to enable auditing for all service accounts and related objects. Once auditing is enabled, regularly check the logs to see whoâ€™s using the accounts, when, and for what purposes. Auditing is one of the most important of the best practices: it helps ensure security, verifies internal processes and compliance measures are being followed, and can discover any issues or breaches before too much time passes.

### 7. Implement access rights management software.
Carefully managing your Active Directory service accounts is crucial to preventing misuse of broad access and privileges. An access rights management tool can be beneficial to ensure user accounts are set up and managed with appropriate permissions and access.


### Restrict access to non public endpoints to Azure

### Restrict access to app services to Front Door

### Enforce Layers Isolation
Each layer could be isolated at the network level through Vnets
Create a VNet for each layer:
web
api
workers & scheduler
backend
data (pgsql + redis)
Then configure for each layer the required access to each other


### Azure Defender

To enable Azure Defender on a subscription, you must be assigned the role of Subscription Owner, Subscription Contributor, or Security Admin.

From the portal's menu, select `Security Center`
From Security Center's sidebar, select Getting started.
From the Select workspaces to enable Azure Defender on list, select the workspaces to upgrade.
Select Upgrade to enable Azure Defender.


Optional: Enable automatic data collection
Security Center collects data from your machines to monitor for security vulnerabilities and threats. Data is collected using the Log Analytics agent, which reads various security-related configurations and event logs from the machine and copies the data to your workspace for analysis. By default, Security Center will create a new workspace for you.

When automatic provisioning is enabled, Security Center installs the Log Analytics agent on all supported machines and any new ones that are created. Automatic provisioning is strongly recommended.

To enable automatic provisioning of the Log Analytics agent:

From Security Center's menu, select Pricing & settings.

Select the relevant subscription.

In the Data collection page, set Auto provisioning to On.

Select Save.
