# About SalesTim Self-Hosted

This documentation is for hosting SalesTim on your own servers and managing your own infrastructure (installation, maintenance, upgrades, server capacity, uptime, backup and so on).

This is different from [SalesTim Cloud](https://www.salestim.com) where we manage everything for your ease and convenience. Take a look at the [differences between SalesTim Cloud and Self-Hosted](./references/self_hosted_cloud_comparison).

**To get started easily, please read our [Getting Started Guide](./deployment/getting_started).**

*Happy hosting!*
