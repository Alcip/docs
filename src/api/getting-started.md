## Key concepts for working with nBold API

### Templates
Templates are at the core of the nBold platform. As a rule of thumb, templates are a combination of two elements:
- A team template, describing the structure and contents of a team.
- A governance policy that may include security and compliance rules.

A template may be created by yourself and saved in your private corporate catalog for internal use. We call this kind of template `Catalog Template`.

### Corporate Catalog
The corporate catalog contains your own private templates, accessible to your end-users, that includes your custom governance policies, such as:
- Naming conventions
- Audience targeting
- Approval rules
- Security automation
- Sensitivity labels

### Jobs
Jobs are governance tasks executed by the nBold Platform automation engine.

Jobs can be requested by the nBold administrators, catalog managers and virtual apps, to perform powerful operations such as:
- Provision a new team based on a template
- Apply governance policies to multiple teams
- Automatically archive teams based on a specific rule


## Use API Explorer to get to know the API
The easiest way to start exploring the data and services available through nBold API is to use [API Explorer](/api/explorer.md).  
API Explorer lets you craft REST requests, adapt the HTTP request headers, and see the data responses.
